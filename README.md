FlutTraderFromConsole
Is a Java application that takes input from the console and outputs the results
in the console itself.

For it to work properly you need to run the main method inside FlutTraderFromConsole
and provide the input through the console.
Example input: 
2
3 5 7 3
2 6 8
0

FlutTraderFromTxtFile
Is a Java application that takes a .txt file and reads it content and outputs
the calculated results in the console.

For it to work as intended you need to provide a .txt file to the main method
and specify the path to the .txt file and run it from there.
Currently the path to the file is set to -> D:/input.txt
To change the path , so it can read your own file please change this line:

String filePath = "D:/input.txt"; // Absolute path to the input file

I am deeply sorry for the rushed solutions but personal matters got out of hand
(I forgot my girlfriend of 3 and a half years's birthday and there was hell to pay,
I hope you understand).
